# Ekar-Moun-Detector
 
The **EKAR** muon detector is situated at the Cima Ekar observatory in Padua, Italy (https://www.oapd.inaf.it) and is used for studying _cosmic rays_. I created this repository to share the firmware of the Arduino board inside the instrument and the software RTCSync used for real-time clock synchronization with UTC time.
